### QUESTION: What is the mean age of older adult patients that speak English and are not white? Show the results by sex.

# The "sample-patient.csv" file is from a HERON request and contains patient-level information.
# We will explore another dataset that is also part of the same HERON request, and contains other relevant variables such as BMI and diagnosis codes.

# Using what you learned today load the file "sample-data.csv" and try to anser the questions below:

sample_data <- read.csv("sample-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = F) # Please note stringsAsFactors argument - it might be easier to set it as false and convert to factor if/when necessary


# How many columns and rows this data set has?
ncol(sample_data)
nrow(sample_data)

# Look at the first 6 rows of the date
head(sample_data)

# How many observations (rows) per patient are available? Try group_by, summarize and n()
sample_data %>%
        group_by(patient_num) %>%
        summarise(n=n())

# How many unique patients are in the data set? Try counting the number of rows from the last table
sample_data %>%
        group_by(patient_num) %>%
        summarise(n=n()) %>%
        nrow()

# How many different variables are available? Try using the function table() in the columns variable
table(sample_data$variable)

# let's look only at the diagnosis of Binge eating disorder. Create a separate data frame that contains only records (rows) that match variable=="Binge eating disorder"
binge_only <- sample_data %>%
        filter(variable=="Binge eating disorder")

# Let's summarise this table so that it contains one record per patient, with the following columns: patient_num, binge_count(count of rows with binge eating diagnoses), earliest_start_date and latest_start date

# We can now calculate the age, in years, of the first diagnosis of binge eating disorder, based on birth date and earliest start date

# we will use a function of the package lubridate, so let's load it
library(lubridate)

full_data <- full_data %>%
